          <h1>Work Term 3 - Leo Bantolino</h1>
        </div>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            For my work term 3 I stayed at Magnet Forensics, where I also worked during work term 2. My decision to stay was mainly because of the great work culture, but also because the project I worked on spanned many phases. And so I knew if I came back I would still be working on new things even though it was the same project. Ultimately, my decision was well worth it. I continued exploring the ins and outs of different technologies such as .NET and AWS, and also continued to make connections throughout the company and work with a ton of smart people.

        <h2>Magnet Forensics</h2>
        <p>

              <h3>Help take lead on transition epic on regression suite to help progress it to 20%. üöÄ</h3>
              <p>
                The team that I was part of (platform team) practiced agile development, and requirements/priorities were constantly changing, which meant progression was not always linear. Despite this, throughout my term, I honed my prioritization skills and effectively communicated and executed key tasks to progress the transition epic to 35%, which initially had a target of 20%. This is not to say I did it alone‚Äîit was with the help of my teammates, who constantly gave tips and coached me on how to navigate development challenges.

                <h3>Help improve regression suite performance by 15% ‚ö°</h3>
              <p>
                This work term was essentially a sequel to my work term 2, and so I had opportunities to improve the tool that I built, specifically improving performance. Many times in development, the initial solution is not always the most efficient, and hence there is often constant refactoring throughout the development cycles. For me, I focused on improving run-time performance by using certain techniques and redefining application behavior. For example, by using hashing techniques on specific content data, I was able to avoid loading actual content data into the app and only consider the hashes, which drastically improved performance. Ultimately, I achieved a 15% improvement in performance by the end of my term.

                <h3>Migrate 98% of Critical Application Baselines. üèóÔ∏è</h3>
              <p>
                One major aspect of my term was to continue the baseline migrations we were performing since my first term at Magnet. Each baseline essentially verified specific behaviours of our product, which is imperative when it comes to this type of industry. The work involved spanned many efforts; sometimes it was as easy as a bug fix, while other times discussion was needed around topics like redefining domain boundaries. As part of the platform team, our big responsibility included making sure we were defining our roles in terms of our product as accurately as possible. Separation of concerns was essentially a big focus when it came to our team. Ultimately, I got to be part of interesting discussions which definitely exercised my critical thinking skills. By the end of my term, my goal was achieved and we reached a 99% completion on baseline migrations.

        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <p>
            My main priority during my term was to help progress the project I helped jumpstart, although sometimes I took tangents and participated in small bug fixes and minor code migrations to explore different parts of the Magnet Forensics product. Overall, I now feel I have a good understanding of what it means to maintain and build great products, which often involves more than just coding and requires deep thinking and strategic planning to execute important objectives.
        </p>
        

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            At a high level, progressing the project was a big highlight for me. Seeing our internal user base give feedback and actually use it was very rewarding. I've learned how to become a better programmer with a knack for optimizing performance, and lastly, my ability to traverse through situations with minimal information helped me become more efficient and smarter as a programmer, which effectively helped baseline migration reach 99%.

        <h2>Ackowledgements üëã</h2>
            I would like to thank my team: Morgan McLellan for teaching and coaching me on how to better think about testing, Matthew Moody for consistently motivating me, Ryan Fitzpatrick, Matthew Wright, Anda Vulpoi, and Cagan Eraydin.
